                <h2>The problem</h2>
                <p>Homeowners considering solar face a confusing landscape. Sales-driven installers have financial incentives to recommend systems regardless of actual feasibility. Online calculators provide rough estimates but lack the nuance to account for shading, roof conditions, or local cost variations. The result is that many people either avoid solar when it would benefit them, or invest in systems that never deliver promised returns.</p>
                
                <h2>What we built</h2>
                <p>KnowYourSolar provides independent solar feasibility assessments for residential properties. We analyze roof photographs, combine them with location-specific climate data from NREL, and produce reports that include production estimates, cost-benefit analysis, and clear recommendations.</p>
                <p>Critically, our methodology allows us to conclude that solar is not viable when the evidence supports that conclusion. We are not incentivized to recommend installation in marginal cases.</p>

                <h2>Who built this</h2>
                <p>KnowYourSolar was created by Vihari Piratla, a computer science student at UC Santa Cruz with a focus on practical applications of machine learning and web development.</p>
                <p>The project emerged from a recognition that solar feasibility assessment is a tractable technical problem that has been poorly served by existing market incentives. By separating assessment from installation, it becomes possible to provide neutral analysis.</p>

                <h2>Current status</h2>
                <p>KnowYourSolar is currently calibrated for Santa Cruz County, California. The methodology uses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Computer vision analysis of roof photographs to extract pitch and shading characteristics</li>
                    <li>NREL PVWatts data for location-specific solar irradiance modeling</li>
                    <li>Regional cost data from local installer surveys and marketplace aggregators</li>
                    <li>PG&E rate structures and net metering policies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Reports are generated as HTML documents that include all assumptions, data sources, and uncertainty ranges.</p>

                <h2>Limitations and scope</h2>
                <p>This is not a mature commercial service with extensive validation. It is a systematic attempt to provide better information than currently available to homeowners, built with transparent methodology and clear acknowledgment of what it cannot account for.</p>
                <p>The assessment cannot replace a physical site evaluation by a qualified installer. It cannot predict changes in utility policy, equipment failures, or shifts in household electricity usage. It provides a feasibility estimate based on current data and stated assumptions.</p>

                <h2>Why independence matters</h2>
                <p>The fundamental constraint is this: if we took commissions from installers, we could not credibly tell homeowners when solar doesn't make sense. If we optimized for lead generation, our methodology would drift toward optimistic assumptions.</p>
                <p>By charging for assessment rather than installation, the incentives align with accuracy rather than volume. This is not a noble commitment but a structural requirement for the service to have value.</p>

                <p>This project is maintained as an independent effort. We do not have partnerships with installers, utilities, or equipment manufacturers.</p>
