                <h2>Why this exists</h2>
                <p>Solar decisions are hard—not because the technology is complicated, but because incentives are often misaligned.</p>

                <p>KnowYourSolar exists to answer one question honestly:</p>
                <p><b>Does solar make sense for this home>?</b></p>
                
                <p>This charter explains how we protect that answer from influence.</p>
                
                <h2>What we will never do</h2>
                <p>These are more than promises. These are constraints.</p>
                <ul class="constraint-list">
                    <li>We will not accept commissions, referral fees, or per-installation payments from installers.</li>
                    <li>We will not change results based on who requests a report or who may benefit from it.</li>
                    <li>We will never recommend solar unless the numbers justify it.</li>
                    <li>We will not suppress or omit findings that suggest solar is not viable for a home.</li>
                    <li>We will not use language that overstates benefits, suggests certainity, or creates urgency.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Transparency Clause</h2>
                <p>Every report is accompanied by clear disclosures, including:</p>
                <ul class="disclosure-list">
                    <li>All major assumptions used in production and savings calculations</li>
                    <li>Known limitations and sources of uncertainty</li>
                    <li>The geographic scope and callibration of our analysis</li>
                    <li>The methodology version and date used to generate the report</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Nothing material is hidden behind sales language or fine print.</p>

                <h2>Conflict disclosure standard</h2>
                <p>KnowYourSolar is built so our recommendations do not depend on who benefits from them.</p>
                <p>If a relationship ever introduces a potential conflict, it will be stated plainly alongside our reports, with a clear explanation of how report integrity is preserved.</p>

                <p><b>Disclosure is not a fallback. It is part of how independence is enforced.</b></p>
                <h2>How this charter is enforced</h2>
                <p>This charter is not aspirational. It describes how we actually operate.</p>

                <p>If we cannot maintain these standards, we will update this page to reflect reality—rather than allow our principles and practices to drift apart.</p>

                <p>We believe clarity is more valuable than appearances.</p>

                <h2>What this means for you</h2>
                <p>You can read a KnowYourSolar report knowing that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No one is paid more if you install solar</li>
                    <li>No one is penalized if you don't</li>
                    <li>The recommendation exists to inform your decision, not to move you toward a transaction</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>That is the whole point</b></p>
