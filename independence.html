                <h1>Independence Charter</h1>
                <p>Our commitments to remain independent and aligned with homeowner clarity.</p>

                <h2>Why this exists</h2>
                <p>Solar decisions are hard—not because the technology is complicated, but because incentives are often misaligned.</p>

                <p>KnowYourSolar exists to answer one question honestly:</p>
                <p><b>Does solar make sense for this home>?</b></p>
                
                <p>This charter explains how we protect that answer from influence.</p>
                
                <h2>What we will not do</h2>
                <ul class="constraint-list">
                    <li>We will not accept per-installation commissions or referral fees from solar installers.</li>
                    <li>We will not modify report outputs based on who requests the assessment or who may benefit from a particular recommendation.</li>
                    <li>We will not participate in lead generation arrangements that create financial incentives to recommend solar regardless of feasibility.</li>
                    <li>We will not suppress or omit findings that suggest solar is not economically viable for a given property.</li>
                    <li>We will not use marketing language that overstates savings potential or certainty of outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Transparency Clause</h2>
                <ul class="disclosure-list">
                    <li>All major assumptions used in production and savings calculations, including system size, efficiency losses, utility rate assumptions, and degradation rates.</li>
                    <li>The scope and limitations of our analysis, including what factors we cannot account for and where uncertainty is highest.</li>
                    <li>The geographic calibration of our methodology and any adjustments made for specific locations.</li>
                    <li>The version and date of the methodology used to generate each report.</li>
                    <li>Any changes to our business model or partnerships that could affect our independence.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conflict disclosure standard</h2>
                <p>If our incentives ever conflict with homeowners' clarity, we will disclose it.</p>
                <p>We recognize that perfect independence is difficult to maintain as a business scales. If we enter arrangements that create potential conflicts, we will state them clearly and explain how we mitigate their impact on report accuracy.</p>

                <h2>Enforcement</h2>
                <p>This charter represents operational constraints, not aspirational goals. If we cannot maintain these standards, we will update this page to reflect actual practice rather than allow misalignment between stated principles and business reality.</p>
