                <p>Our analysis may conclude that solar is not financially viable for your property. When that happens, we explain why and suggest alternatives worth considering.</p>

                <p>We may recommend against solar installation when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heavy tree shading would reduce production below economic viability</li>
                    <li>Roof replacement is needed within 5 years</li>
                    <li>Roof orientation or pitch results in poor solar exposure</li>
                    <li>Utility rates are too low to justify the investment timeline</li>
                    <li>System size would be too small due to roof constraints</li>
                    <li>Local permit costs or HOA restrictions create excessive barriers</li>
                    <li>Your electricity usage is already minimal</li>

                <p>When solar doesn't make financial sense, other energy actions may still be worth looking into. We do not provide these services, but you may want to consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Home energy audit to identify efficiency improvements</li>
                    <li>Insulation upgrades that reduce heating and cooling costs</li>

                <h2>How estimates are produced</h2>
                <p>We analyze roof photos to extract pitch and shading factors. We combine this with your address to determine orientation and local climate data from NREL PVWatts. Standard system sizing assumptions are applied based on available roof area and estimated usage.</p>
                <p>Production estimates use historical weather data for your location. Cost assumptions are based on recent regional installation averages. Savings calculations account for utility rate structures and net metering policies.</p>
                <p>Currently calibrated for Santa Cruz, CA.</p>

                <h2>Limitations and uncertainty</h2>
                <p>Our estimates are based on assumptions that may not match your exact situation. Actual results can differ due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changes in utility rates or net metering policies</li>
                    <li>Variations in weather patterns from historical averages</li>
                    <li>Differences between estimated and actual electricity usage</li>
                    <li>Installation costs varying by contractor and specific roof complexity</li>
                    <li>Equipment degradation rates differing from manufacturer specifications</li>
